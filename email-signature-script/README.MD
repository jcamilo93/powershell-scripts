# Email Signature Script

## Description

PowerShell script that, based on a template, generates an HTML email signature (for email clients) filling in the placeholders with information from the ActiveDirectory user's attributes.

## Deploying for Outlook

After the email signature is saved to the client folder ´C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Signatures´, the user has to set it manually from the Outlook UI. I haven't found a way to automate as I did for Thunderbird.


## Deploying for Thunderbird

If you wish to change Thunderbird settings to use the signature generated by the script without user intervention. Deploy the thunderbird script after the email signature is saved to the client machine (any folder will work). This script updates the configuration javascript file used by Thunderbird.
